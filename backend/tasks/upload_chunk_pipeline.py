"""
upload_chunk_pipeline.py — Auto-chunked processing for large uploaded audio files.

When a user uploads an audio file longer than UPLOAD_CHUNK_THRESHOLD_SEC (default
3600s / 60 min) the regular run_pipeline is replaced by this function which:

  1. Splits the uploaded WAV into 10-minute chunks on disk using ffmpeg
     (memory-efficient: no audio loaded into Python RAM).
  2. Creates a recording_chunks row for each chunk.
  3. Transcribes each chunk sequentially via run_chunk_pipeline.
  4. Once all chunks are transcribed, calls run_finalize_pipeline which:
       - Diarizes the full audio ONCE (consistent speaker timeline)
       - Runs speaker identification globally across the full audio
       - Merges timestamps correctly across chunk boundaries
       - Generates MoM and stores the unified transcript

This approach is identical to what happens with live long recordings, ensuring
the same code path handles merging, speaker consistency, and AI generation.

Memory guarantees:
  - Each chunk WAV is ~30 MB for 10 minutes of 16 kHz mono audio.
  - Chunks are deleted immediately after transcription.
  - The full-audio WAV is kept for diarization (needed for speaker assignment).
